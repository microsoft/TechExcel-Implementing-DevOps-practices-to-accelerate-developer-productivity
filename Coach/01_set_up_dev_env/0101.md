   1. Leave Dev Box management with the defaults, if you wanted to set a limit on the number of dev boxes a user could create you can do that here.
8. Go back to the Azure Portal and your Resource Group and create a new Virtual network
    ![Select Virtual network](../Media/VirtualNetwork.png)

    You can keep Security and IP addresses to the defaults and create the network
9. Create a new Network Connection in the resource group

10. Make sure it's in your same resource group and the domain join type is set to Azure active directory join. In the network connection details connect it to the network you just created.

11. Once the network connection is created, navigate back to your Dev Center and under Networking add the network connection you just created.

    You can add it before the checks are finished running, they will continue to run once it's been added.

Now you're ready to start creating a custom image to deploy your Dev Box.
